        description:
          'In "Hardcore History" journalist and broadcaster Dan Carlin takes his "Martian", unorthodox way of thinking and applies it to the past. Was Alexander the Great as bad a person as Adolf Hitler? What would Apaches with modern weapons be like? Will our modern civilization ever fall like civilizations from past eras? This isn\'t academic history (and Carlin isn\'t a historian) but the podcast\'s unique blend of high drama, masterful narration and Twilight Zone-style twists has entertained millions of listeners.',
